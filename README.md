# DicodingSubmission_BDWP
The contents of this repository document my efforts during the completion of the "Belajar Dasar Pemrograman Web" course offered by Dicoding. The end product of this course is a landing page which was created using Native CSS and JavaScript.

# Web Description
This web is built mainly using HTML and CSS based on my knowledge. The website is constructed as a model example for promoting and showcasing tourist destinations in Surabaya. Its purpose is to establish the location as a go-to spot for tourism and accessible to everyone.
